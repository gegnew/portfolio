#### About Me

Hello, I am Gerrit Egnew. I am a data engineer and consultant based in
Interlaken, Switzerland. I came to software development from the biological
sciences and engineering, and enjoy turning science into good code. I have
worked in biotech, IIoT, wastewater remediation, neuroscience, and medtech.

As a consultant and software engineer, I have been instrumental in helping
clients realize their objectives. I have worked with team members to gather
requirements, build prototypes, and develop solutions. I have introduced
Agile/Scrum methods to teams lacking a team-management tradition. I nurtured new
team members by educating about software design, patterns, and best-practices.

I have brought savings to financial and human resources by introducing
**Process Automation**, **CI/CD**, code review, testing, and telemetry.

My personal passions center largely on the natural world. I grew up in Idaho,
where I spent my childhood running, kayaking, and climbing in the wilderness. I
have dedicated thousands of hours to exploration of the mountains and rivers in
Idaho and Montana; my greatest passion is to attain a visceral understanding of
a landscape, to be able to move through it with knowledge and confidence. As a
recent transplant to the Alps, I am constantly immersed in the practice of
learning new environments, cultures, and geography.

Currently I am working with [Zeit Medical](https://www.zeitmedical.com/team) on automated at-home stroke detection.
